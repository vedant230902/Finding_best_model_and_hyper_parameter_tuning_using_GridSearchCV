# Finding the best model and hyperparameter tuning using GrisSearchCV

**Project Overview**: This project aims to identify the best machine learning model for classifying iris flowers and optimize its hyperparameters using GridSearchCV. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning, containing measurements of various iris flowers, along with their corresponding species labels. The project involves exploring different classification algorithms, tuning their hyperparameters, and evaluating their performance to select the best model for this task.


1.**Data Preprocessing**: The Iris dataset is loaded and examined to understand its structure and features.

2.**Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning**:

**a**) Several classification algorithms are considered for the task, such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest classifier.

**b**) For each algorithm, a range of hyperparameters is defined along with their potential values.

**c**) GridSearchCV is employed to exhaustively search through the hyperparameter space for each model, using cross-validation to evaluate the performance of different parameter combinations.

3.**Model Evaluation**: The performance of each model is evaluated using cross-validation to ensure robustness and generalization.
Results and Discussion:

4.**Result**: The best performing model and its corresponding hyperparameters are identified based on cross-validation results.
